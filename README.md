#shortly-express
This repo contains a functional URL shortener designed as a single page app. It's built using Backbone.js on the client with a Node/Express-based server. The server uses the Bookshelf.js ORM and EJS for templates.

It uses SQLite, a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.
